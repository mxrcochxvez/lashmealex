# lashmealex Implementation Plan

## Document Status

- Status: Draft for review
- Last updated: 2026-04-08
- Project type: SSR ecommerce storefront for a local eyelash and beauty business
- Primary goal: Sell beauty products online with pickup at the salon, while preserving branding and improving SEO

## What We Know

- Business name: `lashmealex`
- Existing site: `https://lashmealex.glossgenius.com/`
- Existing site role: remains the primary booking destination
- Business type: local beauty / lash salon in Fresno, CA
- Products: beauty products, especially lash-related items
- Checkout expectations: Apple Pay and Venmo
- Fulfillment: pickup at physical location
- Business operations: owner must be able to log in, manage inventory, and perform product CRUD
- SEO matters: product pages and local business pages should be crawlable and indexable
- Stack preference: Vue is familiar, but the build should favor maintainability and agent productivity

## Current Brand Inputs From Existing Site

These are the initial brand tokens we should preserve and refine in the new design system:

- Primary accent pink: `#FF7BEF`
- Secondary slate: `#5A5E6D`
- Tertiary slate: `#727587`
- Dark background: `#2C2E32`
- Darker background: `#1B1D21`
- Cover image exists on the current site and should be reviewed for reuse
- Current positioning is clearly local and service-based, so the product store should still feel tied to the salon rather than a generic cosmetics shop

Important note:

- The current site already exposes local business data and service information. The new app should preserve and improve that, not replace it with a purely ecommerce-first experience.
- The new store should operate as a sister site to the existing GlossGenius booking site.
- Appointment booking should continue to route users to the existing GlossGenius experience.

## Recommended Architecture

### Recommendation

Use `Next.js` for the storefront and `Medusa` for commerce backend + admin.

### Why This Is The Best Fit

- `Next.js` gives us SSR, route-level metadata, strong SEO primitives, and broad ecosystem support.
- `Medusa` gives us a commerce backend, admin dashboard, product catalog, inventory, orders, regions, and extensibility without platform fees.
- The Medusa admin gives the owner a usable back office for product CRUD and stock management without us building a full custom admin from scratch.
- Medusa supports manual fulfillment flows, which fits pickup orders well.
- This stack is currently more maintainable by AI agents than a mostly custom Vue build because:
  - examples and integrations are easier to find,
  - React and Next have more mature commerce starter patterns,
  - Medusa’s default storefront path is Next-based,
  - a large portion of the needed functionality already exists out of the box.

### Why Not Lead With Vue / Nuxt

Nuxt could absolutely work, but it would increase custom integration effort for commerce flows, checkout, account management, and long-term agent productivity. Since the main requirement is maintainability plus fast delivery, not framework familiarity, `Next.js + Medusa` is the pragmatic choice.

## High-Level System Design

### Frontend

- `Next.js` App Router
- SSR / static pre-rendering where appropriate
- Product listing pages
- Product detail pages
- Cart and checkout
- Pickup selection and pickup instructions
- Booking CTA modules that hand users off to GlossGenius
- CMS-like editable marketing sections stored in code first, then optionally moved to content management later
- Structured metadata for SEO and social sharing

### Backend

- `Medusa` server
- `PostgreSQL` database
- Medusa admin for owner login and product/inventory CRUD
- Manual fulfillment flow for pickup orders
- Order state management for pickup ready / picked up

### Payments

- `Stripe` for card payments and Apple Pay
- `PayPal` integration for Venmo availability in checkout

Important payment note:

- Apple Pay is straightforward through Stripe.
- Venmo usually comes through the PayPal/Venmo path, so this will likely require either a Medusa PayPal provider integration or a small custom payment provider module if an off-the-shelf package is not sufficient.
- This is still materially cheaper than adopting a hosted commerce platform with recurring platform fees.

### Deployment

- Storefront on `Vercel`
- Medusa backend on `Railway`, `Render`, or similar Node-friendly host
- `PostgreSQL` on managed hosting such as Neon, Railway Postgres, or Supabase Postgres
- Object storage for product images in production, likely `S3` or compatible storage

## SEO Strategy

SEO should be built into the architecture, not added later.

### Core SEO Requirements

- SSR product pages with clean URLs
- Unique metadata per product and category page
- XML sitemap generation
- `robots.txt`
- Canonical URLs
- Open Graph and Twitter metadata
- Product schema via JSON-LD
- Local business schema via JSON-LD
- Pickup / location details on relevant pages
- Fast image delivery with responsive sizes and compression
- Strong internal linking between home, shop, product, about, contact, and pickup info pages

### Local SEO Requirements

- Dedicated contact / location page
- NAP consistency: business name, address, phone
- Pickup instructions page or section
- Booking links should point to the current GlossGenius booking flow
- Fresno location references where appropriate, without keyword stuffing
- Optional future additions:
  - FAQ content
  - reviews/testimonials
  - service pages that cross-link to product pages

## Functional Scope

### Customer-Facing Features

- Home page aligned with existing brand
- Shop page with filters
- Product detail pages
- Cart
- Checkout
- Apple Pay support
- Venmo support
- Pickup-only fulfillment at launch
- Order confirmation page

- Persistent "Book Appointment" CTA that links to GlossGenius

### Admin Features

- Admin login for owner

- Mark order as picked up

### Deferred / Nice-To-Have Features

- Customer accounts
- Discount codes
- Bundles / kits
- Gift cards
- Loyalty / referral

- Deeper booking integration beyond handoff to the current salon booking system

## Data Model Direction

### Product

- Title
- Slug
- Description
- Short description
- Price
- Compare-at price
- SKU
- Inventory quantity
- Category
- Brand
- Images
- Featured flag
- Active / draft status

### Product Metadata

- Lash type
- Style
- Length
- Curl
- Material
- Reusable / single-use
- Pickup notes if needed

### Order

- Customer contact info
- Payment status
- Fulfillment status
- Pickup status
- Pickup name
- Pickup instructions
- Order notes

## UX / Brand Direction

The new site should feel more premium and editorial than the existing booking page while keeping obvious continuity with the current brand.

### Visual Direction

- Keep the bright pink as the signature accent
- Avoid a generic beauty-template look
- Use a more polished dark editorial palette with selective pink highlights
- Emphasize product photography and salon trust signals
- Blend product selling with local salon credibility
- Make booking and shopping feel like two connected flows from the same brand

### Proposed IA

- `/`
- `/shop`
- `/products/[slug]`
- `/about`
- `/book`
- `/pickup`
- `/contact`
- `/cart`
- `/checkout`

### Booking Handoff Strategy

- The new storefront will not replace the current booking system.
- `Book Appointment` actions should deep-link users to `https://lashmealex.glossgenius.com/`
- The home page, navigation, footer, and relevant product/brand sections should all provide clear paths to booking services.
- The `/book` route can exist as a branded handoff page with service context, trust copy, and a strong CTA into GlossGenius.

## Technical Decisions To Lock Early

### Decision 1

- Framework: `Next.js`

### Decision 2

- Commerce backend: `Medusa`

### Decision 3

- Database: `PostgreSQL`

### Decision 4

- Payment setup:
  - `Stripe` for Apple Pay and standard card flows
  - `PayPal/Venmo` integration for Venmo checkout

### Decision 5

- Fulfillment model: pickup only for V1

### Decision 6

- Auth model:
  - Medusa admin user for owner
  - customer accounts optional, not required for V1

## Risks And Open Questions

### Risk 1: Venmo Integration Complexity

- Apple Pay is low risk.
- Venmo is achievable, but it is the most likely area to require custom payment integration work.

Mitigation:

- Treat Venmo as a dedicated milestone.
- If needed, ship Apple Pay + cards first in staging while finishing Venmo before production launch.

### Risk 2: Brand Assets

- We currently have color values and image URLs from the live site, but not a formal brand kit.

Mitigation:

- Add a brand discovery pass before UI implementation.
- Confirm logo assets, preferred typography, and photography rights.

### Risk 3: Pickup UX

- Pickup sounds simple, but order state clarity matters.

Mitigation:

- Keep fulfillment pickup-only in V1.
- Add clear order states: `paid`, `ready for pickup`, `picked up`.

### Risk 4: Scope Drift

- There is a natural temptation to combine booking, products, CMS, loyalty, and content in one phase.
- There is also a risk of accidentally duplicating booking functionality that already exists on GlossGenius.

Mitigation:

- Keep V1 narrowly focused on products + pickup + payments + SEO.
- Treat booking as a handoff flow, not a rebuilt subsystem.

## Recommendation Summary

- `PostgreSQL`
- `Stripe` for Apple Pay
- `PayPal/Venmo` for Venmo
- pickup-only fulfillment for launch

This gives us a strong base without locking the business into a high-fee hosted commerce platform or forcing us to build an admin from scratch.
